## DNA Wordle
This project consists of multiple aspects that both team members are very interested in. As biology majors, we are very familiar with the central dogma and the processes behind how DNA is made into the proteins within our bodies. DNA is first transcribed into RNA which is then translated into an amino acid sequence. The nucleotides, the basic unit of a nucleic acid, are arranged in specific orders which are recognized as codons. A codon is a sequence of three nucleotides that codes for one specific amino acid. These specific amino acids all have a single letter abbreviation which will be utilized in our project code. Given our familiarity with these pathways from our coursework, we wanted to take these principles and design a game that could be fun for users. Our code begins by having a dictionary that contains 10 different DNA sequences. One will be randomly chosen one for the user to participate in the game with. The DNA will then be transcribed into the complementary strand of RNA. From here, the code will loop through that RNA sequence in order to tell the user which amino acids are apart of the RNA strand using their single letter abbreviations. The user then will have to unscramble the single letter abbreviations in order to come up with a random 6 letter word.

## Marine Mammal Sound Game Description
Through interacting with this Notebook, we hope to underscore the importance of recording marine mammal
acoustic data by (1) sharing it directly with you, thanks to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
(NOAA) Fisheries New England/Mid-Atlantic Sounds in the Ocean database, (2) engaging you in a guessing
game called, Guess Who? Marine Mammal Edition, and (3) providing a feedback plot to help you visualize how
difficult it might be to analyze audio data without bioinformatics (the bar plot will display how many times a
player correctly guesses each marine mammal). Acoustic researchers use the same type of data provided in the
database to conduct new studies and maintain records for status updates on endangered or threatened marine
mammals.
